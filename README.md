# Bot bmo
This is a personal bot that runs on Discord.

# Running
I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. Just call the join command with an invite URL to have it on your server. The following files are added to be part of my portfolio.

> *P.S. This bot was originally made to entertain my friends and I. I deleted some unnecessary parts before I uploaded here. You may find this bot complete on my profile of Repl.it (the original one) which means it still has the deleted parts.*
